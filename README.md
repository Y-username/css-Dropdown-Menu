# CSS Dropdown Menu

#### learning point
1. build the basic structure by using nav, button, ul, li and a elements
2. styling nav bar and button
3. delete underline of Link by link-style: none
4. remove default padding of the menu
5. use https://cssmatic.com/ to set up box-shadow 
6. to make the rollover of link more smoothly, set up duration and timing-function of transition: background-color, color
7. to make a rolldown effect of nav bar, need to use a div as a wrapper for button and links
8. to make a visual indicate of button, use the .dropdown:hover button.when there are more than one elements under a class, hover need to point out which one
9. to make nav bar rolldown from button, set the default Y-axis position of dropdownmenu to -100%, and make it change to 0 when hovered
10. to make the rolldown effect less jerky, set up transform duration and time function!!!
11. in order to fix the problem that link sit on top of Dropdown Button, need to use a z-index property, which for elements stack upon eachother
12. .dropdown:hover .dropdownMenu means it select the div with .dropdownMenu class when the div with .dropdown class is hovered
